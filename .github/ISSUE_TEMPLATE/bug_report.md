Share with me your stats html file. It does not contain your source code - it is completely safe. You can send it to my email (see my github profile).

If you cannot provide me stats html file:

[ ] Provide relevant section of your rollup config (at least plugins used).
[ ] Provide your node and dependencies versions
[ ] Your OS type and version
[ ] Screenshot of problem

If you do not follow template, issue will be closed without comment.
